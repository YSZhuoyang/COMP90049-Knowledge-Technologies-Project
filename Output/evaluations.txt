one of the really bad films of the year. it would be tempting to blame it on writer/director brad silberling, but no one in this film acquits him or herself admirably. susan sarandon struggles to bring her usual fiery passion to a<br /><br />dully-written part, dustin hoffman looks great but is otherwise a bore, and<br /><br />jake gyllenhaal comes across as an annoying tobey maguire clone, but<br /><br />even more annoying than tobey.<br /><br />the nadir? possibly this line from sarandon: "you've given us all a big<br /><br />truth enema." yeah, there's eloquence for you! gyllenhaal whines his way<br /><br />through an unbelievably bad courtroom scene that provokes a desire to<br /><br />smack him one, and holly hunter looks embarrassed as a district attorney. <br /><br />a low mark for all concerned.

Evaluation result: Bad!

it was a good show idea and very funny. but i didn't feel that suspense feeling i was hoping to get. the commercials are too long and ill placed. it takes away from the show if you can mop the kitchen floor during breaks. but the show is a good idea and has humor which is something series like law and order don't have as much as. so for its lack or suspense it makes up for in humor and uniqueness.

Evaluation result: Neutral

quite a well-made film reminding of point of destination. in some parts definitely smarter than the latter (nb: and made one year earlier).<br /><br />mainly suitable cast, good score, rainy melancholy-soaked background, odd camera angles etc. first half of the film is in fact nearly excellent (something like a very good millennium episode, only - series in question never got that good). unfortunately afterwards some certain slack in the intrigue starts to show up when the authors tend to delay obvious revelations and artificially hold up things from happening. no particular special effects, but thoroughly created atmosphere. a jolly good christopher lloyd.<br /><br />bottomline, apparently not an 'a' feature, but indeed worth watching for fans of a diverse range of films: xfiles, millennium, point of destination, fallen, prophecy etc.

Evaluation result: Good!
