one of the really bad films of the year. it would be tempting to blame it on writer/director brad silberling, but no one in this film acquits him or herself admirably. susan sarandon struggles to bring her usual fiery passion to a<br /><br />dully-written part, dustin hoffman looks great but is otherwise a bore, and<br /><br />jake gyllenhaal comes across as an annoying tobey maguire clone, but<br /><br />even more annoying than tobey.<br /><br />the nadir? possibly this line from sarandon: "you've given us all a big<br /><br />truth enema." yeah, there's eloquence for you! gyllenhaal whines his way<br /><br />through an unbelievably bad courtroom scene that provokes a desire to<br /><br />smack him one, and holly hunter looks embarrassed as a district attorney. <br /><br />a low mark for all concerned.

it was a good show idea and very funny. but i didn't feel that suspense feeling i was hoping to get. the commercials are too long and ill placed. it takes away from the show if you can mop the kitchen floor during breaks. but the show is a good idea and has humor which is something series like law and order don't have as much as. so for its lack or suspense it makes up for in humor and uniqueness.

quite a well-made film reminding of point of destination. in some parts definitely smarter than the latter (nb: and made one year earlier).<br /><br />mainly suitable cast, good score, rainy melancholy-soaked background, odd camera angles etc. first half of the film is in fact nearly excellent (something like a very good millennium episode, only - series in question never got that good). unfortunately afterwards some certain slack in the intrigue starts to show up when the authors tend to delay obvious revelations and artificially hold up things from happening. no particular special effects, but thoroughly created atmosphere. a jolly good christopher lloyd.<br /><br />bottomline, apparently not an 'a' feature, but indeed worth watching for fans of a diverse range of films: xfiles, millennium, point of destination, fallen, prophecy etc.

in the wake of every race there lies a place and a person that will be missed. hellman's existential fable about a driver, a mechanic, a girl and a square becomes the amalgamation of the american dream and its boundaries. ultimately it's about the places you never saw and the people you've never met.<br /><br />"two-lane blacktop" is a benchmark film in every possible way. beautifully shot and edited it hurtles towards an incredible anti-climax. singer james taylor, beach boys-drummer dennis wilson and the wonderful warren oates (who was tommy lee jones before tommy lee jones) race and pine through the american vastness in search of, well, that's anybody's guess.<br /><br />i doubt a single hollywood studio would finance a movie like this today. which is all the same, since hellman has already made it, and with the criterion release the road-dreamers of this and the last century can cherish it, before they get into their 55 chevy to head out again.<br /><br />see you out there...with the shut down strangers and hot rod angels.

my son is 8 and he enjoyed it. at three hours it was a too long for me, but i remember watching tarzan movies for hours on saturday mornings when i was his age, including those awful mike henry in south america tarzan movies. this was better than those. so, even though i didn't like it much, i'm glad movies are still being made that a kid can watch and get lost in. one thing i thought was puzzling, they kept introducing characters that they never really did anything with. steven waddington was the only supporting character that managed to shine. the history was of course pretty silly, but they "fixed" that at the end. it made my son want to know more, so we went on the web and looked up what really happened. definitely a "b" movie, with limited special effects and wooden acting, but still fun for kids.

*caution potential spoilers and road hazards ahead* route 666 is actually the kind of lightweight straight-to-video extravaganza that would make a good date flick. whoever you're with, they'll get bored quickly and want something else to do. the premise had potential, that being federal agents stuck in the middle of nowhere with a prisoner, being pursued by homicidal ghouls. unfortunately, the execution is as bland and bleak as the desert landscape that surrounds them.<br /><br />lou diamond phillips sleepwalks and occasionally "trips" through the film, and his is the best performance. steven williams does add some oomph to the proceedings, too. the rest are wrung from the "hey, memorize the script and recite the lines" academy.<br /><br />speaking of script, in route 666, a lot of talk replaces any modicum of action. well, suspense for that matter, seems to have taken a holiday, also. what's left, is a talky, unexciting, predictable outing that has a couple of good moments. route 666? don't go there, girlfriend.<br /><br />not recommended.

inconvenient woman is a fabulous miniseries, based on the book by dominick dunne. dunne took the plot partially from the alfred bloomingdale scandal. the movie is hot stuff, starring rebecca de mornay as flo, the waitress who attracts the wealthy jules, played by jason robards. jules and his wife (jill eikenberry) are married in name only. jules falls for flo and sets her up in grand style.<br /><br />as the title suggests, flo becomes inconvenient, particularly after jules dies suddenly.<br /><br />the film is peppered with slimeballs, and they're all excellent, including roddy macdowell, chad lowell, grant cramer, and alex rocco. demornay is perfect casting as flo. peter gallagher is the writer on whom it falls to tell flo's story, and chelsea field is his love interest from a high social station.<br /><br />an inconvenient woman is entertaining, interesting, and sad. i loved it.

as someone who was fortunate enough to be at the world premiere of calendar girls in september last year, and to have met angela baker (the inspiration for julie walters' character) on several occasions, i would like to say that this is an amazing true story beautifully realised on film.<br /><br />in real life the "girls" are just as inspiring, funny and brave as you expect them to be. i think that it is important to remember that there is a very serious message underlying this film - the devastation that a disease like leukaemia (or lymphoma, which angela's husband died from in real life) can wreak on a family.<br /><br />the charity that the original calendar girls donated to is the leukaemia research fund, and i would encourage anyone who was moved by the film to seek them out and make a donation at www.lrf.org.uk. so far the girls have raised just over Â£1 million, but there is still so much to do to fight these deadly diseases.

i can pretend no knowledge of cinematography or mr. angelopoulos. but i know greece and i love her people. in july my 14 year old son and i traveled to cappadocia, turkey in search of some remains of the neighborhood where his great grandfather iordanis lived until the great exodus of anatolian greeks in 1923. reading the summary of the film (refugees from odessa) i thought that perhaps i might learn something more about the forced migrations of modern greeks. if i did not have a home in rhodes, had i not been to greece 28 times in as many years, were i not familiar with dozens of islands and cities in greece and if i had never enjoyed the friendship of these ebullient, life-intoxicated people, i might have believed that this lamentation had something to do with modern greece. as a professor at a new jersey state college, let me assure you that i am familiar with the history of the period covered in the film. indeed, my wife's uncle was murdered by the communists during the communist grab for power. my mother-in-law lived through the italian invasion and german occupation...barely. these characters on the screen speak greek, they listen to greek music but who are they? no, they are not even vaguely greek. of course they are not people at all but simply allegories. they are that which the artist invents when life does not entirely fit or is inadequate to his perception of how it was or should have been. all represent some aspect of post wwi greece that greater outside forces consigned to a fate they didn't deserve. as we joked in the late 70's in america: "the revolution didn't happen." for an ideologue/artist, this is no joke. it's in fact grounds to put us through two and a half hours of torment. and it's all because the various powers (eleni's soliloquy of "guards" in different colored uniforms) didn't allow the generation after the "aristocrats" of 1919 (spyros) to follow the call of peace and freedom (the music of nikos and his fellow musicians, i.e., the movement, the cause). this dark, surreal revisionism smears the true and heroic efforts of the greek people to sustain their lust for life through the tragedies of the 20th century, to achieve more than any of their balkan neighbors, to have become so politically evolved and globally integrated.

i must say i wasn't expecting much from this when i bought the dvd, but ended up having an absolute blast. matthew nelson gives a surprisingly sympathetic performance. i found myself feeling so sorry for the character, and wanted things to work out for him and his love interest. suffice it to say he finally slips all the way into madness, and seeks bloody retribution on his numerous tormentors. the best moments in this film come from nelson really showing the characters pain. nothing goes right for him, and literally every single person in his life is abusive to him in one way or the other. the dark humor here is hilarious, although some may find the side characters who torture monty, to be way over the top. still that makes all the more amusing when the movie goes all out slasher in the final 20 minutes or so. one negative a couple kills showed the films' low budget. most of it is actually quite effective, but the sprinkler scene for example doesn't quite work. still delivery caught me off guard, and entertained the hell out of me. definitely check this one out.

i just got the vhs on e-bay, and this is one of the strangest flicks i have ever seen. i first found out about this classic on you tube by seeing the 4 and a half minute clip on there, and i was intrigued enough to get the movie. i enjoyed it very much. it was a very interesting story. but i felt that tiger, the lead character, was a scumbag. he used his position and his influence to take advantage of those young girls. he felt that he could get away with it because everyone looked up to him at that school. he was the real leader, not mr. proffer. but he does do a nice thing for ponce, albeit in a sick way, in helping him out with his female troubles after ponce said that he wouldn't touch a dead girl because he hasn't had a live one yet while being questioned by telly savalas's character, sam surcher. in conclusion, i would recommend this movie but i don't approve of some of the behavior in it.

this film is historically significant, but come one, you guys. it's an embarrassingly racist drama that pretends to be racially progressive. louise beavers' character, delilah, is one of the dumbest and most marginalized movie characters ever. audiences in 1934 hailed this role as a breakthrough for black actresses, but a modern audience should see right through it. the really terrible thing about this movie is that it pretends to be solving the world's race problems, but it actually is making them much worse. (spoiler) bea basically steals delilah's pancake recipe, uses her image to sell pancakes, and makes a load of moolah, while delilah, like a good slave, doesn't mind and turns down a cut when offered. a few scenes and shots are interesting, but unless you're a writing a dissertation on films of the early 30s (or you enjoy getting angry), don't bother.<br /><br />

i am quite frankly astonished by the low imdb average for this film. i thought it was a more than respectable suspense thriller. it definitely kept me riveted throughout. gwenyth paltrow, who was offered kate winslet's part in titanic at the time she committed to this project, devles into her role as the unsuspecting fiancee with grace and down to earth affability. but this is clearly jessica lange's film. her psychotic mother-in-law is one of the most disturbing characters i have come across in any film. in my opinion this film rates an 8/10.

i hate to be a spoilsport, and would not wish to hurt the feelings of the portuguese director, aged 100 this year (assuming he is still alive), but this is really a terrible film. it is so badly made, so badly directed, so badly edited, that it can only be described as appallingly amateur. people make better films than that now with their mobile phones. i suppose that the dinner table discussion in the film between catherine deneuve, john malkovich, stefania sandrelli and irene papas (bizarrely taking place in four languages, and everyone pretends to understand papas's greek!), must have been arranged as a tribute to the man who persisted in writing and directing this film despite being in his nineties. it was a touching gesture on their part to honour him and help him out, but the result is not something to boast about. the general idea of having a woman and her little girl visiting all those interesting places like istanbul, and constituting a rather more intellectual travelogue than is usual in tv documentaries, was a sound one. but the execution of this idea was a total failure. i think it best if we were to draw a polite and discreet veil over this project, which may have been worthy but was not worthwhile.

it's a fact that stan laurel and oliver hardy did their best works for the mgm studios. their later works for the twentieth century-fox studios aren't exactly the most classic ones around. this is one of those typical twentieth century-fox laurel & hardy pictures, that in style and humor quite differs from their early work but still has its certain charm and entertainment value, although the movie is far from an hilarious or great one.<br /><br />once again laurel & hardy are in the army. this time the movie focuses on their mishaps in boot-camp. laurel & hardy don't really get to show the best of their qualities in this movie but the provide the movie with a couple of entertaining moments nevertheless. there are a couple of sequences that are still are of comical greatness, such as the scene in which the boys ride in a jeep during a combat exercise but like often was the case in their later movies, there are more misses than hits with its humor. the movie isn't consistently funny but yet it always remains perfectly entertaining to watch, although i would definitely had prefer some more slapstick from the two boys.<br /><br />reason why this movie still works out quite well, is due to its well written story. it makes the movie flow well and also is the reason why this movie is such a perfectly entertaining one. it makes the movie consistent and provides it with some good comical moments and dialog.<br /><br />the love-story of the movie, between the sheila ryan and dick nelson characters, is quite enjoyable and not as distracting as often had been the case in other laurel & hardy pictures<br /><br />the movie is a great looking one with good costumes and sets. it's obvious that they spend quite some money on this movie. the movie ends with quite a big battle sequences that is well fitted into the movie and makes sure that the movie ends with a blast.<br /><br />might not be so hilarious be very entertaining nevertheless.<br /><br />7/10

recently most of my friends recommended this sitcom to me strongly. they rarely push a tv show to such high position. so i started to watch it two month ago. now i have finished all of two seasons. i find it's better than sex and the city from the same writer. it's more close to real life and reflects there are many factors in our real life except sex. i love victory ferd, who has a asia face and good personality. she love joe so much not for his money. especially, when joe was in bad condition, she proposed to him and never gave him up. that's so lovely and moving. i love this show and look forward to the next season.<br /><br />by the way, i like joe very much, who is so gentleman and seems to handle everything. even though, sometimes he is very strong and wanna control the life of victory.
